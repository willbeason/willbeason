- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @willbeason
- I'm a PhD Student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Information Studies, focusing on the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence.
- In my spare time I develop tools for solving differential equations (and making them into art), and design games driven by deep simulations.
